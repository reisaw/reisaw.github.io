Hi! I’m Reisa Widjaja from Indonesia. I received my B.S. in Business Administration (Finance concentration) with a minor in Korean language from the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/). I went on to earn my M.S. in Statistics and Data Science (2020) and my Ph.D. in Applied Statistics (2025) from the [University of Texas at San Antonio](https://www.utsa.edu/). Following my doctoral studies, I joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the [University of Wisconsin–La Crosse](https://www.uwlax.edu/) as an assistant professor.

Brief biography
======

I was born and raised in Indonesia, then spent my teenage years in China before pursuing my studies in the United States. I have a Chinese name, 黄丹绿, which literally translates to “Yellow Red Green”, like the traffic lights!

My last name, Widjaja, is pronounced “Wijaya.”
